# Important Usage Notes

*Before* starting the agent, there are two important notes:

* For full functionality, it is recommended you **disable Protection mode before starting.** Protection mode disables container monitoring and may interfere with hostname detection, among other things.
* The addon will not start without a valid API key. Grab one from `$DD_SITE/organization-settings/api-keys` and save it in the addon's config.
